# One-Block Tetris Homework

In this homework you will develop your first micro:bit program &ndash; a simplified version of the popular game [TETRIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris). The main difference is that there is only one type of block - a single pixel.

The objective of this homework is to let you **familiarize with the MicroPython/micro:bit developing environment**, as well as understanding **non-blocking scheduling**.

## Content of this folder

- _src_: source folder with your python code (_main.py_ and an helper file _timer.py_).
- _demo_: a folder that contains the working example of the game you have to make. Simply drag the _hex_ file on your micro:bit for testing it.
- _images_: a folder with some images for this document.
- _README_: this file, containing the instructions.

## Getting started

- You do not need any additional hardware beside a micro:bit to complete the assignment.
- Download or clone this repository on your computer. Extract the folder from the zip file if necessary.
- Open the folder _src_ containing the source code with VSCode. Make sure the [MicroPython extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MAKinteract.micro-bit-python) is installed correctly (as well as its Python dependency)
- Initialize the sketch by running the comand `micro:bit-python: Initialize the workspace`, but select **empty** as template.
- Flash once the MicroPython environment and then flash the sketch.

## Code requirments

- Blocks always starts at position (0,2) and move downward, 1 row at a time every _500ms_. If there is an obstacle underneath, the block stops there.
- You can use the _left_ (A) and _right_ (B) buttons to move the current block. The system checks for a user input every _100ms_.
- Blocks cannot move to locations that are already occupied.
- If blocks form a _full row_, the row is deleted.
- If one column of blocks reach the top (i.e., all rows are occupied), it is _game over and a SAD face_ appears.

## Tips

- Consider using a list to keep track of the state (on/off) of each one of the 25 pixels.
- The brightness of the builtin LEDs is between 0 (off) and 9 (fully on). In my demo I used the max brightness of 9.
- If you need to change the values assigned to global variables of immutable types (e.g., numbers and booleans) remember to use the keyword `global`. Here an example

```python
x = 0

# Wrong: this will not work!
def changeX (newX):
    # newX is assigned to a new local variable x
    x = newX;

# Correct
def changeX (newX):
    global x
    # x is a reference to the global x
    x= newX;
```

## Submission and grading

Zip your MicroPython sketch (_zip_, not ALZIP, rar or others) and submit this file using the [homework submission system](homework.prototyping.id).

Please note that:

1. Only submissions made with the system will be considered (no direct emails to TA or Prof).
2. You can re-submit as many times as you want before the deadline &ndash; we will consider your last submission.
3. Submissions after the deadline are **NOT** accepted.
4. If the file is too large the system wonâ€™t allow the submission. Remove from the zip file unnecessary files (I only want to see your code!)
5. Do not copy from the Internet or colleagues without attribution. Remember the _honor code policy_.
