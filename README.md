# One-Block Tetris Homework

In this homework you will develop your first micro:bit program - a simplified version of the popular game [TETRIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris). The main difference is that there is only one type of clock - a single pixel. You do not need any additional hardware but a micro:bit.
